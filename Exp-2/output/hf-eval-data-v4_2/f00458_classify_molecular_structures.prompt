We first import the necessary class from the transformers package, which is the AutoModel class.\n2. We then use the from_pretrained method of the AutoModel class to load the pre-trained model 'clefourrier/graphormer-base-pcqm4mv2'. This model has been trained on the PCQM4M-LSCv2 dataset, which contains molecular structures for graph classification tasks.\n3. With the model loaded, you can perform graph classification on your dataset containing molecular structures. The Graphormer model can assist in the classification or representation of molecules, which could be helpful for your pharmaceutical company's drug development process.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import AutoModel\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('clefourrier/graphormer-base-pcqm4mv2')\n# Perform graph classification on your dataset using the loaded model\n", 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('clefourrier/graphormer-base-pcqm4mv2')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Graph Machine Learning', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Graph Classification', 'api_name': 'graphormer-base-pcqm4mv2', 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('clefourrier/graphormer-base-pcqm4mv2')", 'api_arguments': 'pretrained_model_name', 'python_environment_requirements': 'transformers', 'example_code': 'See the Graph Classification with Transformers tutorial.', 'performance': {'dataset': 'PCQM4M-LSCv2', 'accuracy': 'Not provided'}, 'description': 'The Graphormer is a graph Transformer model, pretrained on PCQM4M-LSCv2.
