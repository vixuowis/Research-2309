{'code': "###Instruction: Our company focuses on predicting molecular properties. We need the best model to tackle this problem for our project. We heard about Graphormer and want to start with a pretrained model.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Multimodal Graph Machine Learning\n<<<api_call>>>: AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. You will need to import AutoModel from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. We will load the 'graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1' model which is a graph Transformer model pretrained on the PCQM4M-LSC dataset. This dataset has been used to perform quantum property predictions on molecular graphs, which makes it suitable for your purpose.\n3. Use the model to create a Graphormer instance, which can be used for molecule property predictions or fine-tuned on other tasks.\n4. The pretrained Graphormer model has achieved 1st place in the KDD CUP 2021 for quantum prediction, making it a strong foundation for your company's project.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import AutoModel\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')\n", 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Graph Machine Learning', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1', 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')", 'api_arguments': ['model_name'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers'], 'example_code': 'See the Graph Classification with Transformers tutorial', 'performance': {'dataset': 'PCQM4M-LSC', 'accuracy': '1st place on the KDD CUP 2021 (quantum prediction track)'}, 'description': 'The Graphormer is a graph Transformer model, pretrained on PCQM4M-LSC, and which got 1st place on the KDD CUP 2021 (quantum prediction track).
