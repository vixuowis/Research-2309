Create a custom environment that represents the problem of trying different combinations of headlines and images, and rewards agents based on marketing performance metrics (e.g., click-through rate, user engagement, etc.).\n2. In this custom environment, you could use the Stable-Baselines3 library for training reinforcement learning agents, including the one pretrained on MountainCar-v0 (sb3/dqn-MountainCar-v0), as a starting point.\n3. Fine-tune or train your Reinforcement learning agents, such as the DQN model, on this custom environment using the RL Zoo and Stable-Baselines3 library. This would require implementing your environment and modifying the provided training script (train.py).\n4. Analyze the performance of the trained agents based on the results in the custom environment and identify optimal marketing strategies.\nUnfortunately, since this is a custom environment you will need to build, the pretrained model for MountainCar-v0 cannot be used directly to identify the best marketing strategies. However, it serves as inspiration and provides a starting point for your workflow.", 'api_call': "load_from_hub(repo_id='sb3/dqn-MountainCar-v0',filename='{MODEL FILENAME}.zip',)", 'provider': 'Stable-Baselines3', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Reinforcement Learning', 'framework': 'Stable-Baselines3', 'functionality': 'MountainCar-v0', 'api_name': 'sb3/dqn-MountainCar-v0', 'api_call': "load_from_hub(repo_id='sb3/dqn-MountainCar-v0',filename='{MODEL FILENAME}.zip',)", 'api_arguments': ['algo', 'env', 'f'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['RL Zoo', 'SB3', 'SB3 Contrib'], 'example_code': ['python -m rl_zoo3.load_from_hub --algo dqn --env MountainCar-v0 -orga sb3 -f logs/', 'python train.py --algo dqn --env MountainCar-v0 -f logs/', 'python -m rl_zoo3.push_to_hub --algo dqn --env MountainCar-v0 -f logs/ -orga sb3'], 'performance': {'dataset': 'MountainCar-v0', 'accuracy': '-103.40 +/- 7.49'}, 'description': 'This is a trained model of a DQN agent playing MountainCar-v0 using the stable-baselines3 library and the RL Zoo.
