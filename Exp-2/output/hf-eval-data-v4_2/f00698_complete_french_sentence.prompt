First, import the pipeline function from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. Use the pipeline function to load the \'camembert-base\' model for French and its tokenizer. The model has been pre-trained for Fill-Mask tasks, which is what we need to complete sentences with missing words.\n3. Once the model is loaded, you can pass a sentence with a missing word denoted by the \'<mask>\' token. The model will then try to fill in the missing word based on the surrounding context.\n4. This functionality can serve as a tool for students to practice their French language skills.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\ncamembert_fill_mask = pipeline(\'fill-mask\', model=\'camembert-base\', tokenizer=\'camembert-base\')\nresults = camembert_fill_mask("Le camembert est <mask> :)")', 'api_call': "pipeline('fill-mask', model='camembert-base', tokenizer='camembert-base')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Fill-Mask', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Fill-Mask', 'api_name': 'camembert-base', 'api_call': "pipeline('fill-mask', model='camembert-base', tokenizer='camembert-base')", 'api_arguments': ['model', 'tokenizer'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers', 'torch'], 'example_code': "from transformers import pipeline; camembert_fill_mask = pipeline('fill-mask', model='camembert-base', tokenizer='camembert-base'); results = camembert_fill_mask('Le camembert est <mask> :)')", 'performance': {'dataset': 'oscar', 'accuracy': 'N/A'}, 'description': 'CamemBERT is a state-of-the-art language model for French based on the RoBERTa model.
