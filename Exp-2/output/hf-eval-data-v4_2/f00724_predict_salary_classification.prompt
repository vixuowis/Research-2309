We need to import the TensorFlow Gradient Boosted Trees (TF_Decision_Trees in this case) model along with the necessary preprocessing libraries and methods.\n2. Once we have the data in a structured tabular format, perform preprocessing to clean and tidy the dataset, which typically involves converting categorical features into numerical values and normalizing numerical features.\n3. We then split the dataset into input features (i.e., attributes of the employees) and target (i.e., whether their salary meets or exceeds $50,000).\n4. Train the model using the TF_Decision_Trees API call with the input features and target labels.\n5. Finally, use the trained model to predict if a specific employee's annual salary meets or exceeds $50,000 using the data available in their input features.\n<<<code>>>: # Insert code to preprocess and split the dataset into input_features and target\n# Import the necessary libraries\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom TF_Decision_Trees import TF_Decision_Trees\n# Train the model\nmodel = TF_Decision_Trees(input_features, target)\n# Use the model to predict the salary class of the specific employee's data\nemployee_data = [input_features_data]\nprediction = model.predict(employee_data)\n", 'api_call': 'TF_Decision_Trees(input_features, target)', 'provider': 'Keras', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Tabular Tabular Classification', 'framework': 'Keras', 'functionality': 'Binary Classification', 'api_name': 'TF_Decision_Trees', 'api_call': 'TF_Decision_Trees(input_features, target)', 'api_arguments': ['input_features', 'target'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['tensorflow >= 7.0'], 'example_code': 'https://github.com/tdubon/TF-GB-Forest/blob/c0cf4c7e3e29d819b996cfe4eecc1f2728115e52/TFDecisionTrees_Final.ipynb', 'performance': {'dataset': 'Census-Income Data Set', 'accuracy': 96.57}, 'description': "Use TensorFlow's Gradient Boosted Trees model in binary classification of structured data. Build a decision forests model by specifying the input feature usage. Implement a custom Binary Target encoder as a Keras Preprocessing layer to encode the categorical features with respect to their target value co-occurrences, and then use the encoded features to build a decision forests model. The model is trained on the US Census Income Dataset containing approximately 300k instances with 41 numerical and categorical variables. The task is to determine whether a person makes over 50k a year."}}
