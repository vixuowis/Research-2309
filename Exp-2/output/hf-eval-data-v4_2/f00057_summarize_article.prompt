The company posted a record-breaking revenue of $123.9 billion for the first quarter of 2022, up by 11% from the same period last year. The increase was fueled by stronger demand for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as continued growth in its services segment. Apple\'s operating profit for the quarter came in at $38.3 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. The results surpassed analysts\' expectations, who had anticipated revenue of around $118 billion. This strong performance is largely attributed to the successful launch of the iPhone 13, which has enjoyed robust sales since its debut in September. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement, "Our record-breaking quarter reflects the strength of our entire ecosystem, from our innovative products and services to the unmatched dedication of our teams around the world." Despite the ongoing global supply chain disruptions, Apple has managed to maintain its growth trajectory, thanks in part to its vertically integrated operations and nimble supply chain management. The company is expected to face stiffer competition going forward, particularly in the smartphone market, as rivals introduce new devices and increased pricing pressures."\n\n###Output: Apple posted record-breaking Q1 2022 revenue of $123.9 billion, surpassing expectations due to strong iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales, as well as services segment growth.', 'api_call': "pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Summarization', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Text Summarization', 'api_name': 'facebook/bart-large-cnn', 'api_call': "pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn')", 'api_arguments': ['ARTICLE', 'max_length', 'min_length', 'do_sample'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers'], 'example_code': 'from transformers import pipeline\nsummarizer = pipeline(summarization, model=facebook/bart-large-cnn)\nARTICLE = ...\nprint(summarizer(ARTICLE, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False))', 'performance': {'dataset': 'cnn_dailymail', 'accuracy': {'ROUGE-1': 42.949, 'ROUGE-2': 20.815, 'ROUGE-L': 30.619, 'ROUGE-LSUM': 40.038}}, 'description': 'BART (large-sized model), fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail. BART is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. BART is pre-trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. BART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering). This particular checkpoint has been fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail, a large collection of text-summary pairs.'}}
