It is designed to deal with the unique problems in speech representation learning, such as multiple sound units in each input utterance, no lexicon of input sound units during the pre-training phase, and variable lengths of sound units with no explicit segmentation. The model relies on an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss.'}}
