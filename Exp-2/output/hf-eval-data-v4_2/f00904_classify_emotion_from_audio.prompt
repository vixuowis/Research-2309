{'code': "###Instruction: A psychology company is building a revolutionary means to detect emotions of its clients. Help them create a system to understand emotions from spoken words.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Audio Audio Classification\n<<<api_call>>>: pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er')\n<<<api_provider>>>: PyTorch Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. To achieve this goal, we can use the pre-trained emotion recognition model 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er', which is based on the Wav2Vec2 architecture. First, import the necessary package from Hugging Face Transformers library.\n2. Use the pipeline function to create an instance of the emotion recognition model.\n3. This model is trained on spoken language and can identify emotions, making it suitable for the task.\n4. Feed the audio data to this model to classify the emotion. Ensure that the audio data is sampled at 16kHz, as the model is trained with 16kHz sampled speech audio. \n\nPotential applications can include emotion-aware customer service systems, mental health support, and personalized recommendations based on users' emotions.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nemotion_classifier = pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er')\nemotion_label = emotion_classifier(audio_file_path, top_k=1)\n", 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er')", 'provider': 'PyTorch Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Audio Audio Classification', 'framework': 'PyTorch Transformers', 'functionality': 'Emotion Recognition', 'api_name': 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er', 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er')", 'api_arguments': ['file', 'top_k'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['datasets', 'transformers', 'torch', 'librosa'], 'example_code': 'from datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\ndataset = load_dataset(anton-l/superb_demo, er, split=session1)\nclassifier = pipeline(audio-classification, model=superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er)\nlabels = classifier(dataset[0][file], top_k=5)', 'performance': {'dataset': 'IEMOCAP', 'accuracy': 0.6258}, 'description': "This is a ported version of S3PRL's Wav2Vec2 for the SUPERB Emotion Recognition task.
