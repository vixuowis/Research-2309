{'code': "###Instruction: An educational company is building a document question answering system for their students. They want the system to answer questions about the contents of textbooks and study guides quickly and accurately.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Multimodal Document Question Answering\n<<<api_call>>>: AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. Import the necessary class from the transformers package. This includes AutoModelForQuestionAnswering for the question answering model.\n2. According to the API provided, we need to load the 'hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering' model, which is a tiny random LayoutLM model.\n3. In practice, we would need to fine-tune this model on relevant data before it can be used effectively for answering questions about textbooks or study guides.\n4. Once the model is fine-tuned, we can then use it to answer questions about the contents of educational documents by passing it the document and the question.\n\n*Note: The model provided is not pretrained and is intended as an example. It would require fine-tuning before use.\n\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering\nquestion_answering_model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering')\n# Fine-tune the model and use it for answering questions about educational documents", 'api_call': "AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering')", 'provider': 'Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Document Question Answer', 'framework': 'Transformers', 'functionality': 'Document Question Answering', 'api_name': 'tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering', 'api_call': "AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('hf-tiny-model-private/tiny-random-LayoutLMForQuestionAnswering')", 'api_arguments': [], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers'], 'example_code': '', 'performance': {'dataset': '', 'accuracy': ''}, 'description': 'A tiny random LayoutLM model for question answering.
