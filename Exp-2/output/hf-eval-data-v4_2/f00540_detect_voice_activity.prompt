We require voice activity detection in our audio recordings.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Audio Voice Activity Detection\n<<<api_call>>>: Model.from_pretrained('popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. Firstly, we need to install the Pyannote Audio library (version 2.1.1) which is required for this task.\n2. We import the Model class from the Pyannote Audio library and use the from_pretrained method to load the pre-trained model: 'popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6'.\n3. This model is specifically designed to perform voice activity detection, which is what we aim to do for transcription services.\n4. We can then use this model to analyze audio recordings and detect segments where voice activity is present, which will then be used for transcriptions.\n<<<code>>>: !pip install pyannote.audio==2.1.1\nfrom pyannote.audio import Model\nmodel = Model.from_pretrained('popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6')\n", 'api_call': "Model.from_pretrained('popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Audio Voice Activity Detection', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Voice Activity Detection', 'api_name': 'popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6', 'api_call': "Model.from_pretrained('popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6')", 'api_arguments': 'N/A', 'python_environment_requirements': 'pyannote.audio 2.1.1', 'example_code': 'from pyannote.audio import Model\nmodel = Model.from_pretrained(popcornell/pyannote-segmentation-chime6-mixer6)', 'performance': {'dataset': 'ami', 'accuracy': 'N/A'}, 'description': 'Pyannote Segmentation model fine-tuned on data from CHiME-7 DASR Challenge.
