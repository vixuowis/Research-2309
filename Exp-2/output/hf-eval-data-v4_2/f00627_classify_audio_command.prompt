We can now feed the audio input (a voice command recorded by the smart speaker) into this model for classification.\n4.

It was introduced in the paper AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer by Gong et al. and first released in this repository. The Audio Spectrogram Transformer is equivalent to ViT, but applied on audio. Audio is first turned into an image (as a spectrogram), after which a Vision Transformer is applied. The model gets state-of-the-art results on several audio classification benchmarks.'}}
