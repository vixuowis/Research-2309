First, import the SentenceTransformer class from the sentence-transformers library.\n2. Create an instance of the SentenceTransformer class with the model \'sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1\'. This model is designed to map sentences to high-dimensional dense vector spaces that can be compared for similarity.\n3. For each character\'s conversation lines, encode their text using the model\'s encode method, which will generate an embedding vector representation for each input sentence or paragraph.\n4. Calculate the similarity between different characters\' embeddings to find connections or shared themes in their conversations.\n<<<code>>>: from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\'sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1\')\n\n# Example conversation lines of two characters\nconversation_A = ["I think we should go there.", "What do you recommend?"]\nconversation_B = ["Let\'s check that place.", "Which one do you suggest?"]\n\nembeddings_A = model.encode(conversation_A)\nembeddings_B = model.encode(conversation_B)\n\n# Compute similarity between conversations and analyze connections\n', 'api_call': "SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Sentence Similarity', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Sentence Transformers', 'api_name': 'sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1', 'api_call': "SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1')", 'api_arguments': ['sentences'], 'python_environment_requirements': 'pip install -U sentence-transformers', 'example_code': "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences = [This is an example sentence, Each sentence is converted]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)", 'performance': {'dataset': 'https://seb.sbert.net', 'accuracy': 'Automated evaluation'}, 'description': 'This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 1024 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.'}}
