We need to import the required classes and modules from the flair package. This includes the Sentence class for processing individual sentences and the SequenceTagger class for named entity recognition models.\n2. Load the \'flair/ner-english-ontonotes\' pre-trained model as a SequenceTagger.\n3. Pass the input sentence to the Sentence constructor to create a Sentence object.\n4. Use the loaded SequenceTagger\'s predict method with the Sentence object as an argument to generate the named entities and their respective tags.\n5.
