{'code': '###Instruction: We have a company that processes loan applications.

Can anyone with a monthly salary of $3,000 apply?\n\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Multimodal Document Question Answer\n<<<api_call>>>: pipeline(\'question-answering\', model=\'tiennvcs/layoutlmv2-large-uncased-finetuned-vi-infovqa\')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. We first import the pipeline function from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. We then use the pipeline function to create a question answering model with the pre-trained model \'tiennvcs/layoutlmv2-large-uncased-finetuned-vi-infovqa\' loaded. This model is fine-tuned for document-based question answering tasks.\n3. This model can be supplied with the source document content (\'company policy...\') and the question to be answered from the document (\'Can anyone with a monthly salary of $3,000 apply?\').\n4.
