We import the necessary functions from the transformers library, such as pipeline for audio classification.\n2. We create an audio classification model by specifying the model to be 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid'. This model has been pretrained on the VoxCeleb1 dataset, and it performs speaker identification tasks for speech audio inputs.\n3. During the call, the audio can be recorded, stored, and sampled at 16kHz before processing with the model.\n4. The model analyzes the audio input and classifies the caller's demographics by matching their voice to a known set of speakers in the training data.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\n\nclassifier = pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid')\nresult = classifier(audio_input)\n", 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Audio Audio Classification', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid', 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid')", 'api_arguments': {'model': 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid'}, 'python_environment_requirements': {'datasets': 'load_dataset', 'transformers': 'pipeline'}, 'example_code': 'from datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\ndataset = load_dataset(anton-l/superb_demo, si, split=test)\nclassifier = pipeline(audio-classification, model=superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid)\nlabels = classifier(dataset[0][file], top_k=5)', 'performance': {'dataset': 'VoxCeleb1', 'accuracy': 0.7518}, 'description': "This is a ported version of S3PRL's Wav2Vec2 for the SUPERB Speaker Identification task.
