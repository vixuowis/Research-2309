{'code': "###Instruction: I have a large dataset with both numerical and categorical features related to customer behavior. I want to classify them into different segments for targeted marketing. How do I use a TabTransformer for this task?\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Tabular Tabular Classification\n<<<api_call>>>: TabTransformer.from_config()\n<<<api_provider>>>: Keras\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. We start by installing the 'keras-io/tab_transformer' library in our Python environment, if not already installed.\n2. We then import the TabTransformer from the library, and load it using the from_config() method.\n3. After loading the model, we proceed to preprocess the input data. For categorical features, we encode them into embedding vectors. Numerical features can be passed directly to the model.\n4. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, and use the TabTransformer to fit on the training data.\n5. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify customer behavior into different segments for targeted marketing.\n6. Evaluate the performance on the testing dataset and measure the accuracy.\n<<<code>>>: from keras.tab_transformer.TabTransformer import TabTransformer\n\ntab_transformer = TabTransformer.from_config()\ntab_transformer.fit(X_train, y_train)\npredictions = tab_transformer.predict(X_test)\n\n# You may need to adjust X_train, X_test, y_train variables to match your dataset preprocessing", 'api_call': 'TabTransformer.from_config()', 'provider': 'Keras', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Tabular Tabular Classification', 'framework': 'Keras', 'functionality': 'Structured data learning with TabTransformer', 'api_name': 'keras-io/tab_transformer', 'api_call': 'TabTransformer.from_config()', 'api_arguments': 'N/A', 'python_environment_requirements': 'Hugging Face', 'example_code': 'N/A', 'performance': {'dataset': 'United States Census Income Dataset', 'accuracy': 'N/A'}, 'description': "This model uses self-attention based Transformers structure followed by multiple feed forward layers to serve supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on tabular data. The model's inputs can contain both numerical and categorical features. Categorical features are encoded into embedding vectors before being fed into a stack of Transformer blocks. The contextual embeddings of the categorical features after the final Transformer layer are concatenated with the input numerical features and fed into a final MLP block. A SoftMax function is applied at the end of the model."}}
