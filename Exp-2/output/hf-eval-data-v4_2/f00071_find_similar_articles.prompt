Instantiate a model with the \'sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2\'. This model is trained to derive embeddings for sentences, which can represent their semantic meaning in a 768-dimensional vector space.\n4. The instantiated SentenceTransformer model can be used to encode the given sentences, transforming them into a dense representation.\n5. These dense representations can then be used to find similar articles by comparing the embeddings of the student\'s article to that of other articles within the dataset.\n<<<code>>>: from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\'sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2\')\nresearch_paper_sentence = "The effects of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Arctic."\nencoded_sentence = model.encode(research_paper_sentence)\n# Compare \'encoded_sentence\' with the embeddings of other articles in the dataset.\n', 'api_call': "SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Sentence Similarity', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Sentence Embeddings', 'api_name': 'sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2', 'api_call': "SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2')", 'api_arguments': ['sentences'], 'python_environment_requirements': 'pip install -U sentence-transformers', 'example_code': "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences = [This is an example sentence, Each sentence is converted]\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/nli-mpnet-base-v2')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)", 'performance': {'dataset': 'https://seb.sbert.net', 'accuracy': 'Automated evaluation'}, 'description': 'This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.'}}
