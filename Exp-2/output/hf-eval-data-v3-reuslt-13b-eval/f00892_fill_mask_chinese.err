/root/autodl-tmp/conda-envs/py38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_runtime.py:184: UserWarning: Pydantic is installed but cannot be imported. Please check your installation. `huggingface_hub` will default to not using Pydantic. Error message: '{e}'
  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-chinese were not used when initializing BertForMaskedLM: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
