No model was supplied, defaulted to distilroberta-base and revision ec58a5b (https://huggingface.co/distilroberta-base).
Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilroberta-base were not used when initializing RobertaForMaskedLM: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
