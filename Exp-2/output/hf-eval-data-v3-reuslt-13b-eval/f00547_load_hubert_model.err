Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/hubert-large-ll60k were not used when initializing HubertModel: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g']
- This IS expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of HubertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/hubert-large-ll60k and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
