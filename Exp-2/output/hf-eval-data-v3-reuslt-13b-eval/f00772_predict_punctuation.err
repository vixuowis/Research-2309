No model was supplied, defaulted to dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english and revision f2482bf (https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english).
Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english were not used when initializing BertForTokenClassification: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
