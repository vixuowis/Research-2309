No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 and revision a4f8f3e (https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6).
Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.
Your max_length is set to 50, but your input_length is only 13. Since this is a summarization task, where outputs shorter than the input are typically wanted, you might consider decreasing max_length manually, e.g. summarizer('...', max_length=6)
