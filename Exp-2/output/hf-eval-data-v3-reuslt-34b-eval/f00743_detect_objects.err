2023-12-01 02:01:38.754474: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

/root/autodl-tmp/conda-envs/py38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/models/detr/feature_extraction_detr.py:38: FutureWarning: The class DetrFeatureExtractor is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of Transformers. Please use DetrImageProcessor instead.
  warnings.warn(
The `max_size` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in v4.26. Please specify in `size['longest_edge'] instead`.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/detr-resnet-50 were not used when initializing DetrForObjectDetection: ['model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer4.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer2.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer3.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked', 'model.backbone.conv_encoder.model.layer1.0.downsample.1.num_batches_tracked']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DetrForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DetrForObjectDetection from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
