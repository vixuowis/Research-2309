  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at dslim/bert-base-NER were not used when initializing BertForTokenClassification: ['bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'bert.pooler.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForTokenClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
