Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base were not used when initializing DPRQuestionEncoder: ['question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.bias', 'question_encoder.bert_model.pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DPRQuestionEncoder from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
