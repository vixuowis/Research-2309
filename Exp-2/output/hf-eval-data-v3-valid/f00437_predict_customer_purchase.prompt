Since the given model is trained on the iris dataset using logistic regression, you would need to train a similar model on your specific customer browsing dataset first.\n2. After training the model, import the required libraries joblib and pandas for using the trained model.\n3. Load the trained model using joblib.load() function.\n4. Prepare the customer browsing behavior data by converting it into a pandas DataFrame and selecting the features that the model expects.\n5. Make sure the feature names match the ones that the model is expecting.\n6.
