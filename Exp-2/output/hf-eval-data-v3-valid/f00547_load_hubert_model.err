2023-11-12 03:56:55.956537: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:110] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
2023-11-12 03:56:56.018219: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/hubert-large-ll60k were not used when initializing HubertModel: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g']
- This IS expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of HubertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/hubert-large-ll60k and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
