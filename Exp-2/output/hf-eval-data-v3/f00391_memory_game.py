def memory_game(context: str, question: str, user_answer: str) -> str:
    '''
    This function implements a memory game using a question answering model.
    The game shows a description to the player for a short period, then removes it from view.
    It then asks questions about the displayed description and checks if the player's answer is correct.

    Args:
        context (str): The hidden context that the player needs to remember.
        question (str): The question you want to ask the player based on the context.
        user_answer (str): The answer provided by the user.

    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the user's answer is correct or not.
