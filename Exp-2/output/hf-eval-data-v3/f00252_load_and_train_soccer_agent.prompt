{'code': "###Instruction: The sports equipment company I work for wants to build a virtual soccer training game. The agent must be able to effectively play soccer against another team.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Reinforcement Learning\n<<<api_call>>>: mlagents-load-from-hf --repo-id='0xid/poca-SoccerTwos' --local-dir='./downloads'\n<<<api_provider>>>: ML-Agents\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. The Unity ML-Agents library must be installed, which provides a set of tools to train, embed, and research reinforcement learning algorithms.\n2. The model '0xid/poca-SoccerTwos' should be downloaded to a local directory using the mlagents-load-from-hf command. This model has been trained to play soccer in the SoccerTwos environment.\n3. You need to create a custom configuration YAML file with your desired settings for the agent and its environment.\n4. Launch the training process with the mlagents-learn command, specifying the configuration file and a run id.\n5. The agent will be trained on the SoccerTwos environment, and will optimize its strategy over time to play effectively against another team.\n6. Once the agent is trained, you can integrate it into your virtual soccer training game for users to enjoy.\n<<<code>>>: \n# Download the pre-trained model\nmlagents-load-from-hf --repo-id='0xid/poca-SoccerTwos' --local-dir='./downloads'\n# Train the agent using the custom configuration file\nmlagents-learn <your_configuration_file_path.yaml> --run-id=<run_id> --resume", 'api_call': "mlagents-load-from-hf --repo-id='0xid/poca-SoccerTwos' --local-dir='./downloads'", 'provider': 'ML-Agents', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Reinforcement Learning', 'framework': 'ML-Agents', 'functionality': 'SoccerTwos', 'api_name': '0xid/poca-SoccerTwos', 'api_call': "mlagents-load-from-hf --repo-id='0xid/poca-SoccerTwos' --local-dir='./downloads'", 'api_arguments': ['your_configuration_file_path.yaml', 'run_id'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['unity-ml-agents', 'deep-reinforcement-learning'], 'example_code': 'mlagents-learn <your_configuration_file_path.yaml> --run-id=<run_id> --resume', 'performance': {'dataset': 'SoccerTwos', 'accuracy': 'N/A'}, 'description': 'A trained model of a poca agent playing SoccerTwos using the Unity ML-Agents Library.'}}
