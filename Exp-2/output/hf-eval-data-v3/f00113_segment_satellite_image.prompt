We first import the necessary classes from the transformers and PIL packages, including OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation for the image segmentation model and Image for processing image data.\n2. We then use the from_pretrained method of the OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation class to load the pre-trained model 'shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large'. This model has been trained on the COCO dataset for universal image segmentation tasks, which suits our purpose of segmenting satellite images to analyze land use types.\n3. We load the image data from a file, or it can be acquired directly from the satellite feed.\n4. This model can then be used to analyze an image and segment different objects in it, which can further help in categorizing land use types.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import OneFormerProcessor, OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation\nfrom PIL import Image\nimage = Image.open('satellite_image_path.jpg')\n# replace 'satellite_image_path.jpg' with path to your image\nprocessor = OneFormerProcessor.from_pretrained('shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large')\nmodel = OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained('shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large')\nsemantic_inputs = processor(images=image, task_inputs=['semantic'], return_tensors='pt')\nsemantic_outputs = model(**semantic_inputs)\npredicted_semantic_map = processor.post_process_semantic_segmentation(semantic_outputs, target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]])[0]\n", 'api_call': "'OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large)'", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Computer Vision Image Segmentation', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large', 'api_call': "'OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large)'", 'api_arguments': {'images': 'image', 'task_inputs': ['semantic', 'instance', 'panoptic'], 'return_tensors': 'pt'}, 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers', 'PIL', 'requests'], 'example_code': 'from transformers import OneFormerProcessor, OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nurl = https://huggingface.co/datasets/shi-labs/oneformer_demo/blob/main/coco.jpeg\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\nprocessor = OneFormerProcessor.from_pretrained(shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large)\nmodel = OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(shi-labs/oneformer_coco_swin_large)\n\nsemantic_inputs = processor(images=image, task_inputs=[semantic], return_tensors=pt)\nsemantic_outputs = model(**semantic_inputs)\n\npredicted_semantic_map = processor.post_process_semantic_segmentation(outputs, target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]])[0]', 'performance': {'dataset': 'ydshieh/coco_dataset_script', 'accuracy': 'Not provided'}, 'description': 'OneFormer model trained on the COCO dataset (large-sized version, Swin backbone). It was introduced in the paper OneFormer: One Transformer to Rule Universal Image Segmentation by Jain et al. and first released in this repository. OneFormer is the first multi-task universal image segmentation framework. It needs to be trained only once with a single universal architecture, a single model, and on a single dataset, to outperform existing specialized models across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. OneFormer uses a task token to condition the model on the task in focus, making the architecture task-guided for training, and task-dynamic for inference, all with a single model.'}}
