{'code': "###Instruction: We are building a robot for elderly care. The robot should be able to understand what's happening and take appropriate actions based on the elderly's current activities.\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Reinforcement Learning Robotics\n<<<api_call>>>: model_utils.load_model(model_utils.VC1_BASE_NAME)\n<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. We import the necessary components from the vc_models.models.vit package. This includes the model_utils class, which allows us to load models and apply the appropriate transformations.\n2. We then load the pretrained model by calling the load_model method and passing the VC1_BASE_NAME as the argument. This model is trained on a large dataset of egocentric videos and is designed for EmbodiedAI tasks, which is what we need for our elderly care robot.\n3. The robot's camera will capture the elderly's activities as images, which will then be processed using the model_transforms function to transform the image data into a format that the model can understand.\n4. The transformed image will be passed through the model to obtain an embedding that can be used to understand the scene and make decisions on how the robot should respond to the elderly's current activities.\n<<<code>>>: from vc_models.models.vit import model_utils\nmodel, embd_size, model_transforms, model_info = model_utils.load_model(model_utils.VC1_BASE_NAME)\nimg = your_function_here() # replace `your_function_here()` with your code to capture image using the robot's camera\ntransformed_img = model_transforms(img)\nembedding = model(transformed_img)", 'api_call': "model_utils.load_model('model_utils.VC1_BASE_NAME')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Reinforcement Learning Robotics', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'EmbodiedAI tasks', 'api_name': 'VC1_BASE_NAME', 'api_call': "model_utils.load_model('model_utils.VC1_BASE_NAME')", 'api_arguments': 'img', 'python_environment_requirements': 'from vc_models.models.vit import model_utils', 'example_code': 'model,embd_size,model_transforms,model_info = model_utils.load_model(model_utils.VC1_BASE_NAME)\nimg = your_function_here ...\ntransformed_img = model_transforms(img)\nembedding = model(transformed_img)', 'performance': {'dataset': 'CortexBench', 'accuracy': 'Mean Success: 68.7%'}, 'description': 'The VC-1 model is a vision transformer (ViT) pre-trained on over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources, together with ImageNet.
