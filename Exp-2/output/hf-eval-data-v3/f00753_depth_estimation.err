2023-11-12 09:01:56.133951: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:110] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
2023-11-12 09:01:56.176142: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
2023-11-12 09:01:56.851714: W tensorflow/compiler/tf2tensorrt/utils/py_utils.cc:38] TF-TRT Warning: Could not find TensorRT
No model was supplied, defaulted to Intel/dpt-large and revision e93beec (https://huggingface.co/Intel/dpt-large).
Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.
Some weights of DPTForDepthEstimation were not initialized from the model checkpoint at Intel/dpt-large and are newly initialized: ['neck.fusion_stage.layers.0.residual_layer1.convolution1.weight', 'neck.fusion_stage.layers.0.residual_layer1.convolution1.bias', 'neck.fusion_stage.layers.0.residual_layer1.convolution2.bias', 'neck.fusion_stage.layers.0.residual_layer1.convolution2.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.
