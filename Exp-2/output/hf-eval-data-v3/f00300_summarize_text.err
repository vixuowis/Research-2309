Some weights of PegasusForConditionalGeneration were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail and are newly initialized: ['model.encoder.embed_positions.weight', 'model.decoder.embed_positions.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
