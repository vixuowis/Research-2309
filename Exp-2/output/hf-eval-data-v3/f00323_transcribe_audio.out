CUDA_SETUP: WARNING! libcudart.so not found in any environmental path. Searching in backup paths...
DEBUG: Possible options found for libcudart.so: {PosixPath('/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.11.0'), PosixPath('/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so')}
CUDA SETUP: CUDA version lower than 11 are currently not supported for LLM.int8(). You will be only to use 8-bit optimizers and quantization routines!!
CUDA SETUP: PyTorch settings found: CUDA_VERSION=102, Highest Compute Capability: 8.6.
CUDA SETUP: To manually override the PyTorch CUDA version please see:https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/how_to_use_nonpytorch_cuda.md
CUDA SETUP: Required library version not found: libbitsandbytes_cuda102.so. Maybe you need to compile it from source?
CUDA SETUP: Defaulting to libbitsandbytes_cpu.so...

================================================ERROR=====================================
CUDA SETUP: CUDA detection failed! Possible reasons:
1. You need to manually override the PyTorch CUDA version. Please see: "https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/how_to_use_nonpytorch_cuda.md
2. CUDA driver not installed
3. CUDA not installed
4. You have multiple conflicting CUDA libraries
5. Required library not pre-compiled for this bitsandbytes release!
CUDA SETUP: If you compiled from source, try again with `make CUDA_VERSION=DETECTED_CUDA_VERSION` for example, `make CUDA_VERSION=113`.
CUDA SETUP: The CUDA version for the compile might depend on your conda install. Inspect CUDA version via `conda list | grep cuda`.
================================================================================

CUDA SETUP: Something unexpected happened. Please compile from source:
git clone https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes.git
cd bitsandbytes
CUDA_VERSION=102
python setup.py install
CUDA SETUP: Setup Failed!
