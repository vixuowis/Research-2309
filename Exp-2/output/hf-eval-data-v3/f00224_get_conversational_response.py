def get_conversational_response(question):

    This function uses the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline with the 'conversational' task and the pre-trained model 'PygmalionAI/pygmalion-350m' to generate a response to a given question.

    Args:
        question (str): The question to which the model should respond.

    Returns:
        str: The model's response to the question.
