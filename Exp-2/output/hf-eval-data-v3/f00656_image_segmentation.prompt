It was introduced in the paper OneFormer: One Transformer to Rule Universal Image Segmentation by Jain et al. and first released in this repository. OneFormer is the first multi-task universal image segmentation framework. It needs to be trained only once with a single universal architecture, a single model, and on a single dataset, to outperform existing specialized models across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks. OneFormer uses a task token to condition the model on the task in focus, making the architecture task-guided for training, and task-dynamic for inference, all with a single model.'}}
