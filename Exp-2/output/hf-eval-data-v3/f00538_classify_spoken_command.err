2023-11-12 03:46:38.735438: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:110] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
2023-11-12 03:46:38.777332: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

/root/miniconda3/envs/py38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/transformers/configuration_utils.py:380: UserWarning: Passing `gradient_checkpointing` to a config initialization is deprecated and will be removed in v5 Transformers. Using `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` instead, or if you are using the `Trainer` API, pass `gradient_checkpointing=True` in your `TrainingArguments`.
  warnings.warn(
Some weights of the model checkpoint at superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification: ['wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
