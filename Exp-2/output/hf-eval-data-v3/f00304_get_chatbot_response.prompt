First, import the pipeline function from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. Use the pipeline function to create a conversational model with the pre-trained model \'hyunwoongko/blenderbot-9B\'. This is an open-domain chatbot model designed to handle a wide range of topics, including travel-related conversations.\n3. When a user sends a message to the chatbot, the model processes the text input and generates a response. The conversation can continue as long as desired, with the chatbot providing information and assistance about various travel destinations.\n<<<code>>>:from transformers import pipeline\nchatbot = pipeline(\'conversational\', model=\'hyunwoongko/blenderbot-9B\')\nuser_input = "I\'m planning a vacation to Italy.

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.'}}
