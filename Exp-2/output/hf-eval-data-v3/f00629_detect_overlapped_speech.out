Could not download 'pyannote/segmentation' model.
It might be because the model is private or gated so make
sure to authenticate. Visit https://hf.co/settings/tokens to
create your access token and retry with:

   >>> Model.from_pretrained('pyannote/segmentation',
   ...                       use_auth_token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN)

If this still does not work, it might be because the model is gated:
