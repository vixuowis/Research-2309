We use the pipeline function to create an audio classification model with the 'superb/hubert-large-superb-er' pre-trained model, which has been trained to classify emotions based on speech audio.\n3. With this configured pipeline, we can easily analyze the user's recorded message to determine the expressed emotions.\n4.
