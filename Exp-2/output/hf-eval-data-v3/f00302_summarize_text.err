Some weights of PegasusForConditionalGeneration were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/pegasus-xsum and are newly initialized: ['model.decoder.embed_positions.weight', 'model.encoder.embed_positions.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Your max_length is set to 150, but your input_length is only 20. Since this is a summarization task, where outputs shorter than the input are typically wanted, you might consider decreasing max_length manually, e.g. summarizer('...', max_length=10)
