We import the CrossEncoder class from the sentence_transformers package.\n2. We then initialize the CrossEncoder model with the desired pre-trained model \'cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small\'. This model is capable of natural language inference, which means it can determine if a given pair of sentences are contradictory, entailment, or neutral.\n3. When a customer raises a query, and the AI assistant provides a response, we can use this model to predict the relation between both the question and the answer. The model outputs scores for each of the three labels: contradiction, entailment, and neutral.\n4. Based on the scores, the customer support team can review the AI assistant\'s responses and make necessary actions.\n<<<code>>>: from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder\nmodel = CrossEncoder(\'cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small\')\ncustomer_question = "What is the refund policy?"\nassistant_answer = "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all purchases."\nscores = model.predict([(customer_question, assistant_answer)])\n', 'api_call': "CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Zero-Shot Classification', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Zero-Shot Classification', 'api_name': 'cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small', 'api_call': "CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small')", 'api_arguments': ['sentence1', 'sentence2'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['sentence_transformers', 'transformers'], 'example_code': "from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder\nmodel = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small')\nscores = model.predict([('A man is eating pizza', 'A man eats something'), ('A black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people.', 'A man is driving down a lonely road.')])", 'performance': {'dataset': {'SNLI-test': '91.65', 'MNLI-mismatched': '87.55'}, 'accuracy': {'SNLI-test': '91.65', 'MNLI-mismatched': '87.55'}}, 'description': 'Cross-Encoder for Natural Language Inference based on microsoft/deberta-v3-small, trained on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets.
