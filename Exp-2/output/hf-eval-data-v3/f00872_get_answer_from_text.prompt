We first import the necessary classes from the transformers package. This includes the pipeline function for creating a question answering model.\n2. We use the pipeline function to create a question answering model with the pre-trained 'distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad' model. This model has been fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset and is capable of answering questions by extracting relevant information from a given text.\n3. We provide the model with a question and a context (text) to extract the answer from. The context can be any text that the personal assistant app receives from the user or fetches from external sources.\n4. The created model can then be used to extract an answer from the context related to the given question.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nquestion_answerer = pipeline('question-answering', model='distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\ncontext = 'Your given text here.'\nquestion = 'Your question here.'\nresult = question_answerer(question=question, context=context)\nanswer = result['answer']", 'api_call': "DistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')", 'provider': 'Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Question Answering', 'framework': 'Transformers', 'functionality': 'Question Answering', 'api_name': 'distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad', 'api_call': "DistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')", 'api_arguments': ['question', 'context'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers'], 'example_code': "from transformers import pipeline\nquestion_answerer = pipeline(question-answering, model='distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad')\ncontext = r\n...
