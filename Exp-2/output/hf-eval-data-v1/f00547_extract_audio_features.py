def extract_audio_features(audio_sample):
    """
    This function uses the Hubert-large-ll60k model from Hugging Face Transformers to extract features from an audio sample.
    The model has been trained on a large dataset of 16kHz sampled speech audio and is suitable for extracting features from audio samples.
    
    Parameters:
    audio_sample (str): Path to the audio sample file.
    
    Returns:
    features (torch.Tensor): Extracted features from the audio sample.
