# Test function for translate_speech
# This function will test the translate_speech function with a sample Romanian audio
# Since the actual translation can vary depending on many factors (such as the specific words spoken, the speaker's accent, etc.),
# we cannot strictly assert the expected output
# Instead, we will simply check that the function returns a result without throwing an error
