def classify_audio(audio_input):
    """
    This function classifies the demographics of a caller using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
    It uses the 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid' model which is pretrained on the VoxCeleb1 dataset.
    The model performs speaker identification tasks for speech audio inputs.
    The audio input should be recorded, stored, and sampled at 16kHz before processing with the model.
    The model analyzes the audio input and classifies the caller's demographics by matching their voice to a known set of speakers in the training data.
    
    Parameters:
    audio_input (str): The audio input to be classified.
    
    Returns:
    dict: The classification result.
