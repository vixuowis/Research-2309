# Function to segment birds in an image
# Uses the Mask2Former model from Hugging Face Transformers
# The model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset
# The image is loaded from a URL and preprocessed
# The preprocessed image is fed into the model to perform instance segmentation
# The segmentation outputs are post-processed to obtain the final segmented image
# The function returns the predicted instance map
