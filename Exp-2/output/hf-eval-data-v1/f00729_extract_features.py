def extract_features(input_text):
    """
    This function is used to extract features from text and code using Transformer models.
    It uses the pre-trained CodeBERT model 'microsoft/codebert-base' from Hugging Face Transformers.
    The model is specifically designed for extracting features from both natural language text and code.
    
    Parameters:
    input_text (str): The input text or code from which features are to be extracted.
    
    Returns:
    Tensor: The embeddings or feature representations generated by the model.
