def fill_mask(text):
    '''
    This function uses the DeBERTa model from Hugging Face Transformers to fill in the blanks in a given text.
    The DeBERTa model is a powerful language model that has been pre-trained on large text datasets.
    It is particularly useful for filling in short blanks in sentences, quizzes, or trivia questions.
    
    Args:
    text (str): The text with a blank denoted by [MASK].
    
    Returns:
    str: The text with the blank filled in.
