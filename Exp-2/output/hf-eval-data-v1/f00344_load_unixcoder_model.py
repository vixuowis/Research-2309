    This function loads the Unixcoder model from Hugging Face Transformers.
    Unixcoder is a unified cross-modal pre-trained model that leverages multimodal data (i.e. code comment and AST) to pretrain code representation.
    Developed by Microsoft Team and shared by Hugging Face. It is based on the RoBERTa model and trained on English language data.
    The model can be used for feature engineering tasks.
