# Function to predict carbon emissions
# This function loads a pre-trained machine learning model and uses it to predict carbon emissions based on input data
# Input: data (pandas DataFrame) - The input data to predict carbon emissions
# Output: predictions (numpy array) - The predicted carbon emissions
