def video_genre_classification(video_data):
    """
    This function classifies the genre of a video using the XClipModel from Hugging Face Transformers.
    It uses a pre-trained model 'microsoft/xclip-base-patch16-zero-shot' for general video-language understanding.
    The function extracts features from the video data and assigns genres based on similarities to known examples.
    
    Parameters:
    video_data (str): The video data to be classified.
    
    Returns:
    features (torch.Tensor): The extracted features from the video data.
