# Function to capture Romanian audio
# This is a placeholder function, actual implementation will depend on the specific method used for capturing audio
# For example, it could use a library like pyaudio to capture audio from the microphone
# Or it could simply load an audio file from disk
# The returned audio should be in a format compatible with the translation model
# For example, it could be a numpy array representing the audio waveform
# Or it could be a path to an audio file

# Function to translate Romanian speech to English
# Uses the 'facebook/textless_sm_ro_en' model from Fairseq, provided by Hugging Face
# This model is specifically designed for speech-to-speech translation from Romanian to English
# The function captures Romanian audio, translates it to English, and returns the English audio
