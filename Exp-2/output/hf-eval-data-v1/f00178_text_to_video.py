def text_to_video(scene_description):
    """
    This function uses the Hugging Face Transformers to create a text-to-video pipeline.
    It loads the model 'ImRma/Brucelee', which is capable of converting Persian and English text into video.
    Using a provided scene description from the script, the model generates a video based on that description.
    Please note, however, that GPT models cannot create actual video or audio outputs, and this function is hypothetical.
    
    Parameters:
    scene_description (str): The scene description from the script.
    
    Returns:
    video_result: The generated video based on the scene description.
