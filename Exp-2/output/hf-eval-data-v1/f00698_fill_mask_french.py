def fill_mask_french(sentence):
    '''
    This function uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to fill in a missing word in a French sentence.
    The function uses the 'camembert-base' model, which is a state-of-the-art language model for French based on the RoBERTa model.
    The model has been pre-trained for Fill-Mask tasks.
    
    Parameters:
    sentence (str): A French sentence with a missing word denoted by the '<mask>' token.
    
    Returns:
    str: The sentence with the missing word filled in.
