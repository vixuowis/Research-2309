def find_best_bard(table_data):
    '''
    This function uses the TAPAS mini model fine-tuned on WikiTable Questions (WTQ) to find the best bard based on their magical abilities.
    The model is pretrained on a large corpus of English data from Wikipedia and can be used for answering questions related to a table.
    
    Args:
    table_data (dict): The table data about different types of bards and their magical abilities.
    
    Returns:
    str: The best bard with the highest magical ability.
