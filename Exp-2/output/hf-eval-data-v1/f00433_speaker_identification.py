    This function is used to identify the speaker from an audio file.
    It uses the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline function to create the speaker identification model.
    The model used is 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-sid' which specializes in speaker identification.
    
    Parameters:
    audio_file_path (str): The path to the audio file.
    
    Returns:
    speaker_identification (list): A list of the top 5 predicted speakers.
