    This function authenticates a user's voice using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers.
    The model used is 'anton-l/wav2vec2-base-superb-sv', which is trained for speaker verification tasks.
    
    Parameters:
    voice_sample (str): Path to the voice sample to be authenticated.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the voice is authenticated, False otherwise.
