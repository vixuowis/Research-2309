    '''
    This function implements a memory game using the distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad model from the transformers package.
    The game works by showing a description to the player for a short period, then asking questions about the displayed description.
    The model checks if the player's answer is correct by providing the question and the hidden context to the model.
    
    Parameters:
    context (str): The hidden context that the player needs to remember.
    question (str): The question you want to ask the player based on the context.
    user_answer (str): The answer provided by the user.
    
    Returns:
    str: A message indicating whether the user's answer was correct or not.
