def question_answering(context: str, question: str) -> str:
    '''
    This function uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to answer questions based on a given context.
    It uses a pretrained model 'deepset/roberta-base-squad2-distilled', which is a distilled version of the deep-set Roberta model trained on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset.
    
    Parameters:
    context (str): The context based on which the question will be answered.
    question (str): The question that needs to be answered.
    
    Returns:
    str: The answer to the question based on the given context.
