def detect_keywords_in_audio(audio_file_path):
    """
    This function detects keywords in a given short audio clip using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
    It uses the 'superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-ks' model which is designed for keyword spotting (KS) and is pretrained on 16kHz sampled speech audio.
    The function returns the top 5 most probable keywords that are present in the clip.
    
    Parameters:
    audio_file_path (str): The path to the audio file.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of the top 5 most probable keywords in the audio clip.
