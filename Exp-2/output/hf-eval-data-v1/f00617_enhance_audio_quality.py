# Function to enhance audio quality
# This function uses the pre-trained model 'JorisCos/DCCRNet_Libri1Mix_enhsingle_16k' from Hugging Face Transformers
# The model is trained to enhance audio signals by separating the target speech component from the background noise
# The function takes in the path to the podcast audio file and the desired path for the enhanced output
# It returns the path to the enhanced audio file
