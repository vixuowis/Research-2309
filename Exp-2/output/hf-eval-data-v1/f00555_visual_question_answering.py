# A Visual Question Answering function
# This function uses the 'JosephusCheung/GuanacoVQAOnConsumerHardware' model from Hugging Face to answer questions about images.
# The model has been trained on the GuanacoVQADataset and is designed to work on consumer hardware like Colab Free T4 GPU.
# The function takes as input the path to an image and a question about the image, and returns the model's answer to the question.
