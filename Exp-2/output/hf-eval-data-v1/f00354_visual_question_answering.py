# Function to answer questions about an image using a pre-trained model
# The function takes two arguments: the path to the image and the question to be answered
# It uses the 'microsoft/git-base-textvqa' model from Hugging Face Transformers, which has been fine-tuned for visual question answering
# The function returns the answer to the question
