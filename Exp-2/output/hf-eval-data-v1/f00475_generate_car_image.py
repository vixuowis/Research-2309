def generate_car_image():
    '''
    This function generates a new image of a car using the pre-trained model 'google/ddpm-cifar10-32'.
    The model is a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) which is a class of latent variable models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
    It is used for high-quality image synthesis.
    The generated image is saved to a file named 'ddpm_generated_image.png'.
