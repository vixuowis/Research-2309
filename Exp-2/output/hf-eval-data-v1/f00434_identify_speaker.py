# Function to identify the speaker from a voice recording
# Uses the Hugging Face Transformers library and a pre-trained model for speaker verification
# The model is trained on 16kHz sampled speech audio, so make sure your input is also sampled at 16kHz

    # Load the pre-trained model and processor
    processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained('anton-l/wav2vec2-base-superb-sv')

    input_values = processor(audio_file, return_tensors='pt').input_values

    # Use the model to identify the speaker
    embeddings = model(input_values).last_hidden_state
