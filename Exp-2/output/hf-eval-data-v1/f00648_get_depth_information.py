# Function to get depth information from an image
# This function uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers for depth estimation
# The model has been fine-tuned for depth estimation tasks which are useful for robot navigation applications
# The function takes an image path as input, preprocesses the image, and then uses the model to predict the depth information
# The depth information is then extracted from the model's output and returned
