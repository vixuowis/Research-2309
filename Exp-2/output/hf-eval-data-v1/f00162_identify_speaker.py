def identify_speaker(dataset_name):
    '''
    This function identifies the speaker in an audio file using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
    It uses the 'superb/hubert-large-superb-sid' model which is pretrained for speaker identification.
    The audio input should be sampled at 16Khz.
    
    Args:
    dataset_name (str): The name of the dataset to be loaded.
    
    Returns:
    speaker_identity (dict): A dictionary containing the speaker identities for each audio file in the dataset.
