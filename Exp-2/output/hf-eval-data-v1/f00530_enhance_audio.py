# Function to enhance audio clarity
# This function uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face Transformers to enhance the clarity of speech in an audio file.
# The model has been trained to remove background noise and improve the clarity of speech, making it easier for people with hearing problems to understand.
# The function takes as input an audio file and returns an enhanced version of the same audio.

    # Process the input audio file
    enhanced_audio = audio_enhancer.process(input_audio)
    # Return the enhanced audio
