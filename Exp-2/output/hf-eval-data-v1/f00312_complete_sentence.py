    This function uses the 'xlm-roberta-base' model from Hugging Face Transformers to complete a sentence.
    The model is a multilingual version of RoBERTa pre-trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data containing 100 languages.
    It can be used for masked language modeling and is intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.
    
    Args:
        sentence (str): The sentence to be completed. The sentence should contain a '<mask>' token where the model should complete the sentence.
    
    Returns:
        str: The completed sentence.
