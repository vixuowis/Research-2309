Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
It is strongly recommended to pass the ``sampling_rate`` argument to this function. Failing to do so can result in silent errors that might be hard to debug.
