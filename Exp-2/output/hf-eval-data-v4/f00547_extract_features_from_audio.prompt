We first import the necessary class from the transformers package. This includes HubertModel for the feature extraction model.\n2. We then use the from_pretrained method of the HubertModel class to load the pre-trained model 'facebook/hubert-large-ll60k'. This model has been trained on a large dataset of 16kHz sampled speech audio and is suitable for extracting features from audio samples.\n3. The loaded model can be used to analyze an audio sample and identify its beats and other features, which could be useful for music producers or various audio processing applications.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import HubertModel\nhubert = HubertModel.from_pretrained('facebook/hubert-large-ll60k')\n# Use the model for feature extraction on the audio sample\n", 'api_call': "HubertModel.from_pretrained('facebook/hubert-large-ll60k')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Feature Extraction', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Feature Extraction', 'api_name': 'hubert-large-ll60k', 'api_call': "HubertModel.from_pretrained('facebook/hubert-large-ll60k')", 'api_arguments': 'pretrained model name', 'python_environment_requirements': 'transformers', 'example_code': "hubert = HubertModel.from_pretrained('facebook/hubert-large-ll60k')", 'performance': {'dataset': 'Libri-Light', 'accuracy': 'matches or improves upon the state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 performance'}, 'description': 'Hubert-Large is a self-supervised speech representation learning model pretrained on 16kHz sampled speech audio. It is designed to deal with the unique problems in speech representation learning, such as multiple sound units in each input utterance, no lexicon of input sound units during the pre-training phase, and variable lengths of sound units with no explicit segmentation. The model relies on an offline clustering step to provide aligned target labels for a BERT-like prediction loss.'}}
