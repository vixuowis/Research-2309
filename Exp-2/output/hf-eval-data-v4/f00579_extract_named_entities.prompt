Import the pipeline function from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. Use the pipeline function to create a named entity recognition (NER) model.\n3. Specify the model \'dslim/bert-base-NER-uncased\' to be loaded. This model has been trained to perform named entity recognition on uncased text, which means it can recognize entities such as person names, locations, and organizations even in lowercased text.\n4. The created NER model can then be used to process the news articles to extract named entities. This will allow the media organization to efficiently identify and analyze key people, places, and organizations featured across the articles.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nner_model = pipeline(\'ner\', model=\'dslim/bert-base-NER-uncased\')\nnews_article = "Large parts of Los Angeles have been hit by power outages with electricity provider Southern California Edison pointing at high winds as the cause for the disruption.
