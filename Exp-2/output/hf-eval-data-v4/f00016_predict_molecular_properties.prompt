Import the necessary libraries like AutoModel from transformers.\n2. Use the 'from_pretrained' method to load the model 'graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1'.\n3. The chosen model, Graphormer, is a graph Transformer model that has been pre-trained on the PCQM4M-LSC dataset to predict molecular properties.\n4. The Graphormer model got 1st place in the KDD CUP 2021 (on the quantum prediction track) and is suitable for graph-based molecular prediction tasks.\n5. The model can be used for analyzing molecular representations and provide information on their properties or optimize them for specific applications.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import AutoModel\ngraph_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')", 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Graph Machine Learning', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1', 'api_call': "AutoModel.from_pretrained('graphormer-base-pcqm4mv1')", 'api_arguments': ['model_name'], 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers'], 'example_code': 'See the Graph Classification with Transformers tutorial', 'performance': {'dataset': 'PCQM4M-LSC', 'accuracy': '1st place on the KDD CUP 2021 (quantum prediction track)'}, 'description': 'The Graphormer is a graph Transformer model, pretrained on PCQM4M-LSC, and which got 1st place on the KDD CUP 2021 (quantum prediction track).
