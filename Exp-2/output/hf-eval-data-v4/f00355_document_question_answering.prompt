We import LayoutXLMForQuestionAnswering class from transformers library provided by Hugging Face for the Document Question Answering task.\n2. We use the from_pretrained method to load the pre-trained model with the given model name 'fimu-docproc-research/CZ_DVQA_layoutxlm-base'. This LayoutXLM model has been designed for answering questions related to uploaded documents.\n3. After loading the model, we can use it to process the uploaded documents, extract relevant features, and then answer any questions related to the document.\nIf the question is in textual format, you can input the question along with the features extracted from the uploaded document to predict the answer.\n\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import LayoutXLMForQuestionAnswering\nmodel = LayoutXLMForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('fimu-docproc-research/CZ_DVQA_layoutxlm-base')\n", 'api_call': "LayoutXLMForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('fimu-docproc-research/CZ_DVQA_layoutxlm-base')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Multimodal Document Question Answer', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'CZ_DVQA_layoutxlm-base', 'api_call': "LayoutXLMForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('fimu-docproc-research/CZ_DVQA_layoutxlm-base')", 'api_arguments': '', 'python_environment_requirements': 'transformers', 'example_code': '', 'performance': {'dataset': '', 'accuracy': ''}, 'description': 'A Document Question Answering model based on LayoutXLM.'}}
