We import the pipeline function provided by the Hugging Face Transformers library.\n2. Create a voice activity detection model using the pipeline function, specifying 'voice-activity-detection' as the task and 'funasr/FSMN-VAD' as the model to be loaded.\n3. This model is trained to detect voice activity in audio files, differentiating when the user is speaking and when there is no voice activity.\n4. The created classifier can be used to analyze the audio input during a conference call and determine voice activity, allowing the app to differentiate between speaking and non-speaking periods.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nvoice_activity_detector = pipeline('voice-activity-detection', model='funasr/FSMN-VAD')\nvoice_activity = voice_activity_detector(audio_file_path)\n", 'api_call': "pipeline('voice-activity-detection', model='funasr/FSMN-VAD')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Audio Voice Activity Detection', 'framework': 'Hugging Face', 'functionality': 'Voice Activity Detection', 'api_name': 'FSMN-VAD', 'api_call': "pipeline('voice-activity-detection', model='funasr/FSMN-VAD')", 'api_arguments': {}, 'python_environment_requirements': ['transformers', 'torch'], 'example_code': '', 'performance': {'dataset': '', 'accuracy': ''}, 'description': 'FSMN-VAD model for Voice Activity Detection using Hugging Face Transformers library.'}}
