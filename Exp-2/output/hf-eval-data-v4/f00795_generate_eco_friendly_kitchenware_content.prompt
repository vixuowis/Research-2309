We first import the required functions from the transformers library, including the pipeline and set_seed function.\n2. We create a text-generating model by calling pipeline(\'text-generation\', model=\'facebook/opt-125m\'), which loads the OPT pre-trained transformer \'facebook/opt-125m\'. This model is ideal for generating human-like text content.\n3. The model can be used to generate marketing content for eco-friendly kitchenware by providing it with an initial prompt, like "Introducing our new line of eco-friendly kitchenware:". The model will then continue the text with relevant, creative, and engaging content.\n4. The generated content can be used as marketing material for promoting the eco-friendly kitchenware product line.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\nset_seed(42)\ngenerator = pipeline(\'text-generation\', model=\'facebook/opt-125m\')\ngenerated_content = generator("Introducing our new line of eco-friendly kitchenware:", max_length=100, do_sample=True)[0][\'generated_text\']\n', 'api_call': "pipeline('text-generation', model='facebook/opt-125m')", 'provider': 'Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Text Generation', 'framework': 'Transformers', 'functionality': 'Text Generation', 'api_name': 'facebook/opt-125m', 'api_call': "pipeline('text-generation', model='facebook/opt-125m')", 'api_arguments': {'do_sample': 'True'}, 'python_environment_requirements': 'from transformers import pipeline, set_seed', 'example_code': "generator(Hello, I'm am conscious and)", 'performance': {'dataset': 'Various', 'accuracy': 'Roughly matches GPT-3 performance'}, 'description': 'OPT (Open Pre-trained Transformers) is a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, designed to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale.

The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT can be used for prompting for evaluation of downstream tasks as well as text generation.'}}
