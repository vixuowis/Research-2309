We import the necessary classes from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face, including AutoModelForDocumentQuestionAnswering.\n2.

This model is designed to answer questions from images containing text and layout information.\n3. Convert the invoice image to a text-based format that the model can process, including information about the layout and position of the text elements.\n4.
