{'code': '###Instruction: We have a database of customer voices and are trying to build a voice recognition product so we can recognize customer voices when they call. How should we process and classify?\n###Output: <<<domain>>>: Artificial Intelligence Audio Classification\n<<<api_call>>>: pipeline(\'audio-classification\', model=\'superb/hubert-large-superb-sid\')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1. Import the required libraries: "pipeline" from "transformers" and "load_dataset" from "datasets".\n2. Load and preprocess the audio dataset containing customer voices, ensuring the audio input is sampled at 16Khz.\n3. Create an audio classifier using the pipeline function and specify the \'superb/hubert-large-superb-sid\' model, which is pretrained for the speaker identification task.\n4. For each audio file of customer voices in the dataset, use the classifier to predict the speaker\'s identity by feeding the audio file to the classifier.\n5. Based on the predicted speaker identities, create a speaker-to-voice mapping that can be used for identifying customers when they call.\n6. Label customer voices with their corresponding speaker identities.\n\nHere is the example code:\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ndataset = load_dataset("your_audio_dataset")\nclassifier = pipeline(\'audio-classification\', model=\'superb/hubert-large-superb-sid\')\n\nfor audio_file in dataset:\n    speaker_identity = classifier(audio_file["file"], top_k=5)\n    # Store speaker_identity in your mapping system/database\n```\n', 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/hubert-large-superb-sid')", 'provider': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Audio Audio Classification', 'framework': 'Hugging Face Transformers', 'functionality': 'Transformers', 'api_name': 'superb/hubert-large-superb-sid', 'api_call': "pipeline('audio-classification', model='superb/hubert-large-superb-sid')", 'api_arguments': 'file, top_k', 'python_environment_requirements': 'datasets, transformers, librosa', 'example_code': 'from datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\ndataset = load_dataset(anton-l/superb_demo, si, split=test)\nclassifier = pipeline(audio-classification, model=superb/hubert-large-superb-sid)\nlabels = classifier(dataset[0][file], top_k=5)', 'performance': {'dataset': 'VoxCeleb1', 'accuracy': 0.9035}, 'description': 'Hubert-Large for Speaker Identification.
