First, we import the pipeline function from the transformers library provided by Hugging Face.\n2. We use the pipeline function with \'fill-mask\' as an argument to create a fill-in-the-blanks model. This model can predict and fill in missing words in a sentence.\n3. We specify the model \'bert-large-uncased\' to be loaded. This is a pre-trained model specifically designed to work with masked language modeling tasks, like fill-in-the-blanks.\n4. Once the model is loaded and instantiated, we can pass a sentence with a \'[MASK]\' token representing the missing word. The model will then predict and fill in the missing word in the sentence.\n<<<code>>>: from transformers import pipeline\nfill_in_the_blanks = pipeline(\'fill-mask\', model=\'bert-large-uncased\')\nsentence = "The cat chased the [MASK] around the house."\nfilled_sentence = fill_in_the_blanks(sentence)', 'api_call': "pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-large-uncased')", 'provider': 'Transformers', 'api_data': {'domain': 'Natural Language Processing Fill-Mask', 'framework': 'Transformers', 'functionality': 'Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction', 'api_name': 'bert-large-uncased', 'api_call': "pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-large-uncased')", 'api_arguments': 'text', 'python_environment_requirements': 'transformers', 'example_code': "from transformers import pipeline\nunmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-large-uncased')\nunmasker(Hello I'm a [MASK] model.)", 'performance': {'dataset': {'SQUAD 1.1 F1/EM': '91.0/84.3', 'Multi NLI Accuracy': '86.05'}}, 'description': 'BERT large model (uncased) is a transformer model pretrained on a large corpus of English data using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.
