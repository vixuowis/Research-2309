We first import the necessary classes from the transformers package. This includes Swin2SRForImageSuperResolution for the image super-resolution model.\n2. We then use the from_pretrained method of the Swin2SRForImageSuperResolution class to load the pre-trained model 'caidas/swin2sr-classical-sr-x2-64'. This model has been trained to upscale images by a factor of 2, which is exactly what we need for improving the quality of the user's vacation picture.\n3. We load the user's image, and then pass it to the model to upscale the image and maintain its quality.\n4.
