It was introduced in the paper GIT: A Generative Image-to-text Transformer for Vision and Language by Wang et al. and first released in this repository. The model is trained using 'teacher forcing' on a lot of (image, text) pairs. The goal for the model is simply to predict the next text token, giving the image tokens and previous text tokens. This allows the model to be used for tasks like image and video captioning, visual question answering (VQA) on images and videos, and even image classification (by simply conditioning the model on the image and asking it to generate a class for it in text)."}}
