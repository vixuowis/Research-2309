ImportError: 
TFAutoModelForTokenClassification requires the TensorFlow library but it was not found in your environment.
However, we were able to find a PyTorch installation. PyTorch classes do not begin
with "TF", but are otherwise identically named to our TF classes.
If you want to use PyTorch, please use those classes instead!

If you really do want to use TensorFlow, please follow the instructions on the
installation page https://www.tensorflow.org/install that match your environment.
